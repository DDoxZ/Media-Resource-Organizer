## About
This project focuses on an application that is a media resource organizer, specifically for photos, with many of the features commonly found in applications of this type.

## What we learned
 - Object-Oriented Analysis, Design, and Programming
 - Fluency in using standard notations for object-oriented (OO) analysis and design
 - Effective use of these notations to formulate problems and explore solutions
 - Understanding key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and implementing design solutions in Java
 - Familiarity with standard object-oriented design and implementation patterns

## Directories
This Media Resource Organizer project is divided into these directories:
- ```ui```: contains classes exclusively responsible for the application's user interface
- ```domain```: contains classes whose responsibility is solely related to the application's domain
- ```services```: contains classes responsible for interacting with external services, such as services that retrieve metadata for photos
- ```utils```: contains classes specifically designed for the application but potentially reusable in other contexts
